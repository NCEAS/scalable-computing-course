## Objectives

Groups will start with the tiled output that they made from last session. The main objective in this lesson is to have them rasterize the tiled shapfiles, which we need to do for visualization (and would also be a useful thing to know how to do in an analysis workflow as well).

The groups will need to:

- run the rasterizer method on one file
- write a parsl app that will run it on all of the files
