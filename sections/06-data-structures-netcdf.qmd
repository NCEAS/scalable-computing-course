title: "Data Structures and Formats for Large Data"
---

## Learning Objectives

- Become familiar with the NetCDF format
- Understand the advantages of random-access formats such as NetCDF
- Become familiar with the `xarray` package for working with N-Dimensional datasets

## Introduction

TODO

[Insert amazing image representing "large scale" and "multidimensional"]

## Working with Large Data

TODO

- Size & Dimension, "N-D"
- Data Organization / File Naming?
    - Using hierarchical folder structures
    - Encoding hierarchy into filenames
    - File naming for natural ordering
    - Setting things up for Dask multi-file support

### Exercise

[Short (5-10min) exercise identifying well-structured data storage]

## NetCDF/HDF Overview

TODO

Overview major functionality of NetCDF:

- Multidimensional / N-Dimensional
- Self-describing
- Random access
- Remote access

Other topics:

- Describe available tooling (python packages, Panoply, others?)
- Talk about CF conventions?
- Talk about NetCDF and data archival

## Introduction to Xarray

TODO: Base on https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/getting-started-guide/quick-overview.html but with a course-appropriate dataset.

I want students to both be able to create a NetCDF and work with them.

## Exercise

(30-45min)

TODO: Students work on their own or in pairs to write a script to analyze a NetCDF dataset
