title: "Parallelization with Dask"
---
## Introduction
Dask is a library for parallel computing in Python. 
It can scale up code to use the full capacity of your personal computer or to distribute work in a cloud cluster. 
By mirroring APIs of other commonly used Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, Dask provides a familiar interface that makes it easier to parallelize your code. 
In this lesson, we will get acquainted with some of Dask's most commonly used objects and Dask's way of distributing and evaluating computations.

## Dask Cluster
Dask clusters have three main components for processing computations in parallel. These are the *client*, the *scheduler* and the *workers*.

- When we code, we communicate directly with the **client**, which is responsible for submitting tasks to be executed to the scheduler.

- After receiving the tasks from the client, the **scheduler** determines how tasks will be distributed among the workers and coordinates them to process tasks in parallel.

- Finally, the **workers** are threads, processes, or separate machines in a cluster. They compute tasks and store and return computations results.

In order to interact with the client and generate tasks that can be processed in parallel we need to use Dasks' objects to read our data. Here we will see examples of how to use `dask.dataframes` and `dask.arrays`.

We can deploy a Dask cluster on a single machine or an actual cluster with multiple machines. Here we will use the Dask cluster instead of the default Dask scheduler to take advantage of the *cluster Dashboard*, which keeps track of the performance and progress of our computations.

## Dask Data Frames

When we analyze tabular data, we usually start our analysis by loading it into memory as a Pandas DataFrame. 
But, what if this data does not fit in memory? 
Or maybe our analyzes crash because we run out of memory. 
These scenarios are typical entry points into parallel computing. 
In such cases, Dask’s scalable alternative to a Pandas DataFrame is the `dask.dataframe`. 
A `dask.DataFrame` is made up of many `pd.DataFrames`, each containing a subset of rows of the original dataset.
We call each of these pandas pieces a *partition* of the `dask.DataFrame`.

```{python}
## THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF LOADING A MASSIVE FILE OR CREATING A REALLY BIG DATAFRAME

```


The application programming interface (API) of a `dask.DataFrame` is a subset of the `pd.DataFrame` API.
So if you are familiar with pandas, many of the core `pd.DataFrame` methods directly translate to `dask.DataFrames`. 



A major difference between both objects is that `dask.DataFrames` are *lazy*, meaning that they do not evaluate until we explicitly ask for a result using the `compute` method.
**This is the case with most Dask workloads.**

```{python}
## THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF LAZY COMPUTATION

```


*This means that your framework will queue up sets of transformations or calculations so that they are ready to run later, in parallel. This is a concept you’ll find in lots of frameworks for parallel computing, including Dask. Your framework won’t evaluate the requested computations until explicitly told to. This differs from “eager” evaluation functions, which compute instantly upon being called.*

Lead into task graphs.

## Dask Arrays
If you want scalable NumPy arrays, then start with Dask array

## Best Practices

It is important to remember that, while APIs may be similar, some differences do exist. Additionally, the performance of some algorithms may differ from their in-memory counterparts due to the advantages and disadvantages of parallel programming. Some thought and attention is still required when using Dask.

:::{.callout-warning}
For data that fits into RAM, Pandas can often be faster and easier to use than Dask DataFrame. 
While “Big Data” tools can be exciting, they are almost always worse than normal data tools while those remain appropriate.

        "Understory micrometorology across a larch forest density gradient in northeastern Siberia 2014-2020"
        ~50MB, has a few different axes to filter on

> Dask is convenient on a laptop. It installs trivially with conda or pip and extends the size of convenient datasets from “fits in memory” to “fits on disk”.
