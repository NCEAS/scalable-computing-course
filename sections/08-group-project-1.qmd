title: 'Group Project: Staging and Preprocessing'
---


## Objectives

-Start with a subset of PDG vector data that is untiled/unstaged
-Data will need to be preprocessed
    - staging simplifies polygons, ensures projections are correct, and breaks the input file into tiled sections

Groups will:

- design a high level workflow for the steps? or maybe we give them this
    - workflow should include where inputs, outputs, and scripts will be stored/run
- run the tile staging on one file to estimate how long it would take in series
- write a script that runs the tiling function in parallel (using parsl)

We will give them:

- the data subset (stored on one of the servers in a shared dir)
- the methods and setup parameters to do the tile staging
