title: 'Group Project: Staging and Preprocessing'
---


## Objectives

-Start with a subset of PDG vector data that is untiled
-Data will need to be preprocessed by dividing original shapefiles into regular tiles

Groups need to:

- design a high level workflow for the steps
    - workflow should include where inputs, outputs, and scripts will be stored/run
- write a script that runs the tiling function 
- run the script (in parallel?)

We will give them:

- the data subset (stored on one of the servers in a shared dir)
- a function that will tile the data
