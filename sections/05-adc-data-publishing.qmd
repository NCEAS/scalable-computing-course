Overview of open data and data archival repositories

What is a repository? 
A data repository is a database infrastructure that collects, manages, and stores data. In addition to the [Arctic Data Center](arcticdata.io), there are many other repositories dedicated to archiving data, code, and creating rich metadata. The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), the Digital Archaeological Record (tDAR), Environmental Data Initiative (EDI), and Zenodo are all examples of dedicated data repositories.
