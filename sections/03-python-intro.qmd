author: "Jeanette Clark"

## Learning Objectives

- Basic Python review
- Writing in Jupyter notebooks
- Writing functions in Python

## Introduction

* VS Code + remote development on a cluster is easy and way faster than your local machine
* Jupyter is a great way to do literate analysis
* Functions provide ways to reuse your code across notebooks/projects

## Python on the cluster

* Connect to the server
* Start a `training` project and pick interpreter (this could also go in Sam's session)
* Create and execute `hello.py`
    - from the IDE as a whole
    - from IDE line by line
    - from the terminal

## Jupyter notebooks

* Create a notebook
* Load in some libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib)
* Read in a csv
* group and summarize by a variable
* create a simple plot

## Functions

* create `myplot.py`
* write `myplot()` function to create the same plot we did in section above
* load myplot into jupyter notebook (`from myplot.py import myplot`)
* replace old plot method with new function
