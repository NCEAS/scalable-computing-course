## Learning Objectives

- NSF archival policies for large datasets
- Data transfer tools
- Uploading large datasets to the Arctic Data Center

## Introduction

- there are many different data collection mechanisms that can generate large volumes of data
    - two major types: imagery and model output

> The Office of Polar Programs policy requires that metadata files, full data sets, and derived data products, must be deposited in a long-lived and publicly accessible archive.

> Metadata for all Arctic supported data sets must be submitted to the NSF Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io).

> Exceptions to the above data reporting requirements may be granted for social science and indigenous knowledge data, where privacy or intellectual property rights might take precedence. Such requested exceptions must be documented in the Data Management Plan.

- datasets that are already published on a long lived archive do not need to be replicated to the Arctic Data Center
    - example: a research project accesses many terabytes of VIIRS satellite data. The original satellite data does not need to be published on the Arctic Data Center, but the code that accessed it, and derived products, can be published

- for some numerical models, if the model results can be faithfully reproduced from code, the code that generates the models can be a sufficient archival product, as opposed to the code and the model output
    - if the model is difficult to set up, or takes a very long time to run, we would probably reccommend publishing the output as well as code

## Data transfer tools

- scenario: you need to send a bunch of data to the Arctic Data Center. after getting the credentials, you use `scp` to start the transfer. You know this typically takes around 12 hours so you start it at 5pm right when you leave the office expecting it to be done when you get back. When you arrive, you see there was a short network outage in the middle of the night. The whole job failed so you have to start it again...

There is a better way!

Three key elements to data transfer
    - endpoints
    - network
    - transfer tool

#### Endpoints

The from and to locations of the transfer, an endpoint is a remote computing device that can communicate back and forth with the network to which it is connected. The speed with which an endpoint can communicate with the network varies depending on how it is configured. Performance depends on the CPU, RAM, OS, and disk configuration. Examples:

- NCEAS `datateam` server:
- Standard laptop

#### Network speed

Determines how quickly information can be sent between endpoints, largely dependent on what you pay for. Wired networks get significantly more speed than wireless.

#### Transfer tools

- scp
    - uses `ssh` for authentication and transfer
    - if you can `ssh` to a server, you can probably use `scp` to move files without any other setup
    - copies all files linearly and simply. if a transfer fails in the middle, difficult to know exactly what files didn't make it, so you have to start the whole thing over and re-transfer all the files
- rsync
    - similar to `scp` but syncs files/directories as opposed to copying
    - if the file already exists on the other side, it is skipped
- globus
    - parellelizes transfers by utilizing multiple network sockets simultaneously
    - is able to fail and restart itself efficiently 
    - requires more setup, endpoints need to be configured as globus nodes


#### Globus

- easy to use, as long as your data are accessible via an endpoint configured as a Globus node
- leverage your institutions computing resources! they may be able to help get you access to a data transfer node already configured correctly
- there are paid options to set up a node from your own workstation (Globus Connect Personal)
    - remember the other factors though! Globus won't help you overcome a 1 Gb/s laptop connection speed, or a 50 Mb/s network speed

## Documenting large datasets

- the Arctic Data Center is working to support large datasets, but we have performance considerations as well
- self documenting file formats are preferred, to prevent us from needing to document thousands-millions of files in a single metadata document
    - netcdf
    - others?
- regular, parseable filenames and consistent file formatting is key
- communicate early and often with the Arctic Data Center staff
