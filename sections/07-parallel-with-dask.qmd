- Split-apply-combine
- Dask stuff
    - Lazy eval (compute())
        - Grouping compute() calls versus calling compute() multiple times
    - Dask Array
    - Dask DataFrame
    - Skip or just mention Bag, Delayed, Futures? Not sure yet.
    - visualize()
    - Choosing how many chunks to divide work into
    - Task overhead
    - Distributed dask?
        - Persist
> Dask is convenient on a laptop. It installs trivially with conda or pip and extends the size of convenient datasets from “fits in memory” to “fits on disk”.
